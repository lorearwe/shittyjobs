## Source code for a school assignement
Done by me in 2019 and reviewed in 2021 because previous code was an incredible mess. 
The project started with a bootstrap template which I cleaned up by changing the whole setup into those pretty remote links. 
The rest is just vanilla CSS and HTML. 
 
Graphic design was done by me. Images used are CC licensed.
